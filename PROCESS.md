# day 3
Started coding the app, created a basic layout for MainActivity and PlanActivity. Also created the SQL database and User class.

# day 4
improved functionality of user database, when the app starts MainActivity will check if a user exists and if not immediately start the signup process. 

working on researching the best way to implement food search in the app. The API provided by the USDA seems like a good bet.

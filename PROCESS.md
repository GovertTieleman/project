# day 1
Updated README.md with the final version of the project proposal

# day 2


# day 3
Started coding the app, created a basic layout for MainActivity and PlanActivity. Also created the SQL database and User class.

# day 4
Improved functionality of user database, when the app starts MainActivity will check if a user exists and if not immediately start the signup process. 

Working on researching the best way to implement food search in the app. The API provided by the USDA seems like a good bet.

Managed to scrape text from USDA site by using an URL. Next step: make the database searchable and make a script to alter the raw text and make it usable.

# day 5

# day 6
Implemented food search functionality with a JSONrequest through the USDA food database api. The user can enter a search term and will get a list of foods that match. They can click on the food they want to select and see its nutrional details. The next step will be to show those details and allow the user to select how much of the food they are consuming. Then it will be saved to the database along with the date on which it was consumed in order to create the user's food diary.

# day 7
Implemented nutrient detail screen. The app now allows users to search and find any food item within the USDA database and see all its nutritional values. The next step will be to allow the user to enter how much of the food they have consumed, calculate the nutrients and add the food to the diary database.

# day 8
Switched to new (better API), Nutritionix. Improved layout and functionality of the food search and detail pages. Next step will be to create the nutrient list for the food details and put the foods into the database.

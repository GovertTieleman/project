It's difficult to keep track of the nutrients we ingest into our bodies. This means many people have trouble sticking to a balanced diet. 
For our health conscious fellow humans we would like to make this easier by offering an app that helps them keep track of what they are eating and can tell them if there are any important nutrients lacking in their diet. 

<b>The app will include the following screens</b>

1. where the user can input their daily food intake
2. where the user can see how much of their daily recommended nutrient amounts they are ingesting on a daily/weekly/monthly basis
3. Recommended foods that the user should look to add to their diet

<b>Prerequisites</b>
1. Data sources: the app will need access to a database with all foods and their respective nutrient content
2. External components: ?
3. Similar: #TODO
4. Hardest parts: making the app as user friendly and nice to look at as possible. Interpreting and connecting the nutrient data in the user's diet in order to be able to provide sensible advice to the user.

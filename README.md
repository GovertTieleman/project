# NutriConscious

There are a lot of health conscious people that want to eat a balanced and nutritious diet, however it can be difficult to keep track of what we are eating, and which nutrients may be lacking in our diets. 

This app aims to make it easy for users to keep track of their daily nutrient intake. This means keeping track of calories, macro nutrient ratios and vitamin content of their food.

<b>The app will include the following screens</b>

These features comprise the minimum viable product:
1. Home screen, showing nutrient intake for current day/week/month. (averages)
2. Input screen where the user can enter the type and amount of different foods that they consume.
3. Plan screen, where the user can input their desired type of diet, which includes the macro nutrient ratio they would wish to stick to    as well as the amount of calories.

As an optional feature there may be a screen where the users can get recommendations for food types that their diet is lacking in.

<b>Prerequisites</b>

1. Data sources: the app will need access to a database with all foods and their respective nutrient content. There are many different API's focused on nutrition, and I will try different ones to find the one that is best suitable for this app. 
2. External components: The app will implement and SQLite database in order to save user data. 
3. Similar: There are many apps in the store focused on counting calories. They usually include different features like being able to scan barcodes for nutritional data, giving daily tips to users or providing recipes based on the user's preference. This app will try to stand out from the crowd by focusing on the vitamin content of the user's diet, and providing them with custom advice so they can consume a full range of vitamins.
4. Hardest parts: making the app as user friendly and nice to look at as possible. Interpreting and connecting the nutrient data in the user's diet in order to be able to provide sensible advice to the user.

# NutriConscious
#### by Govert Tieleman

There are a lot of health conscious people that want to eat a balanced and nutritious diet, however it can be difficult to keep track of what we are eating, and which nutrients may be lacking in our diets. 

This app aims to make it easy for users to keep track of their daily nutrient intake. This means keeping track of calories and the macro nutrient ratio of their food. This is especially helpful for people trying to eat a certain carb/fat ratio, like in the keto diet for example. Users can see and adjust the foods they had in their food diary and adjust their weight and goals in their profile.

# NutriConscious
This app aims to make it easy for users to keep track of their daily nutrient intake. This means keeping track of calories, macro nutrient ratios and vitamin content of their food.

<b>The app will include the following screens</b>

1. Home screen, showing nutrient intake for current day/week/month. (averages)
2. Input screen where the user can enter the type and amount of different foods that they consume.
3. Plan screen, where the user can input their desired type of diet, which includes the macro nutrient ratio they would wish to stick to    as well as the amount of calories.
